*First came the air musky, heavy, and faintly sour with mildew.* Then came the floor; cold, unwelcoming concrete that pressed against her palms like stone. One blink. A flash of pale light. Two blinks. A sharp breath, lungs aching as if starved for years. Three blinks... and a face.

“Oh my god! You’re alive!” The voice was soft but trembling with relief. “Told you she wasn’t dead,” came another, sharper voice from somewhere behind her.

Avery groaned, the sound rough and unfamiliar in her throat. As her vision steadied, the blur in front of her resolved into a girl kneeling close dark dress, dark eyeliner, and eyes rimmed with sleepless shadows. The girl smiled, cautious but kind. “Take it slow, okay? You hit the ground pretty hard.”

From the far side of the room came the scrape of chalk against a blackboard. “Hardly. She’s fine,” said the other girl tone lively, theatrical. “The spirits wouldn’t bring someone here just to kill them off.”

Avery’s eyes drifted toward the sound. Another student stood by the board, scrawling symbols in white chalk across a backdrop of dustless black. “Don’t listen to her,” said the first girl quickly. “I’m Jessica. That’s Eden. She just… gets excited about weird things.”

“Occult truths,” Eden corrected, turning with a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“Where are we?” Avery murmured. Jessica hesitated. “We don’t know. I woke up here too.” Eden set down the chalk, her grin widening. “It’s obvious. A cult. They wiped our memories and trapped us in this… ritual space.” Jessica’s expression hardened. “Don’t start, Eden.”

Eden stepped closer, her shoes clicking softly against the concrete. “My name’s Eden,” she said with a flourish, “Ultimate Occultist. And you?” Avery blinked, the question slicing through the fog in her mind. “Uh…” A sudden, sharp pain struck behind her eyes a flash of something she couldn’t grasp and then, clarity. “My name’s Avery… Ultimate Ordinary.”

Eden tilted her head, a grin curling at the edge of her lips. “That’s it? Ultimate Ordinary?” She let out a short, incredulous laugh. “That’s fucking shit!” “Eden!” Jessica snapped, voice sharp enough to cut through the tension. Eden raised her hands in mock surrender, smirk never fading. “What? I’m just saying—out of every talent, *hers* is Ordinary? Like seriously?”

Avery looked between them, still dizzy, her mind struggling to piece together anything beyond her name. Outside, something heavy shifted, and a dull thud echoed from the hallway.
